        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a programming approach that uses object and classes to organize and structure code.It focuses on classes,objects,encapsulation,inheritance,polymorphisim,abstraction methods which helps to create modular,reusable and maintainable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- In oop a class is a template or blueprint of creating objects. It defines the structure and behaviour of objects including their attributes and methods. Essentially class is user defined data-type that organizes  information and enables code reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- In oop object is a instance of a class it is a real world entity that has both the attributes and methods that defines it behaviour.Object are created from a class and it represent to the specific class with their real values.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- In oop both are the key concepts but both serve diffrent purposes.\n",
        "Abstraction method focuses to on hidding complexity and showing only essential features of an object. But  encapsulation bundling all the methods and attrribute to a single class and access it with diffrent access modifiers like private,public and protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- In oop dunder method are alos known as magic method or special methods these are pre difined methods of python that allows you to define how your object behaves in certain situation.And it called byt double underscore by starting and ending of the name ex:- (__init__).\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance in oop is a mechanism that allows a new class to acquire the attributes and methods of an existing class . It promotes code reuse and creates a natural relationship between classes, where the subclass extends or modifies the behavior of the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in oop is the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or operation in different ways. The word \"polymorphism\" comes from the Greek words \"poly\" (many) and \"morph\" (form), meaning \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, with each subclass having its own specific implementation of the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is the concept of bundling attributes and the methods that operate on the data within a single class. It also involves restricting access to certain components of the object, making the internal workings of the class hidden from the outside world. This is done to prevent direct modification of the objects data and to provide controlled access through getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the attributes of the object with default or provided values. In Python, the constructor is defined using the __init__ method.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- The class method and static method both are the methods belongs to the class itself but there are some difference between both.\n",
        "The Classmethod  is a method that is bound to the class not the instance.It takes the class itslef as the first argument which is usally named as cls.Classmethod is defined as @classmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "The static method is a method belongs to the class but does not have the access to the class or it instance iot works like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.It is defined as @staticmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading in python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with same name but diffrent arguments.But like others python does not directly support method overloading by defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- In oop  method overriding refers to the process where a subclass  provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, the property decorator is used to turn a method into a read-only or read-write property. This allows you to define methods that can be accessed like attributes, but still maintain control over how the values are accessed or modified. It's a way to encapsulate attribute access and provide getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean and Pythonic way.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is one of the core principles of oop, and it is crucial because it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In simple terms, polymorphism enables different classes to provide a common interface and share common behavior, even though their internal implementations may differ.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. It serves as a blueprint for other classes, providing a common interface and potentially some shared functionality. Abstract classes are used to define common methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring that the subclasses adhere to a certain structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- OOP promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability by organizing code into self-contained objects with defined behaviors and attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- A class variable can be shared  by all instance of the class. It is defined within the class but outside any methods. But instance varible is specific the particular instance of the class it is also defined within the methods and unique to eache instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- In python multiple inheritance  refers to the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a class to combine features from multiple parent classes, making it more versatile and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- In Python, both __str__ and __repr__ are special methods used to define how an object should be represented as a string, but they serve slightly different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "The __str__ method is used to define a \"user-friendly\" or informal string representation of an object, which is meant to be readable and understandable for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "The __repr__ method is used to define a \"formal\" or unambiguous string representation of an object, which should ideally allow for reconstruction of the object when passed to eval() or should be a more detailed representation for debugging purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function used to call a method from a parent or a superclass special in the context of inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is special method which automatically called when the object is about to destoryed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- The difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lies in what they receive as their first argument and how they interact with the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "In @staticmethod it doesn't take self or cls as the first argument it works like regular function but belongs to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "In @classmethod it take class itself as the first argument by using namespace cls.It access or modify class variables and be used to create alternative constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python allows objects of different classes to be treated using a common interface, especially when those classes are related by inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex:-\n",
        "\n",
        "class car:\n",
        "   def model(self):\n",
        "     return \"car model name\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "class tyota(car):\n",
        "    def model(self):\n",
        "      return \"car model is tyoyta\"\n",
        "\n",
        "class bmw(car):\n",
        "    def model(self):\n",
        "      return \"car model is bmw\"\n",
        "\n",
        "obj = [tyota(),bmw()]\n",
        "\n",
        "for i in obj:\n",
        "    print(i.model())\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called in a single line, one after another, using the dot (.) operator. This works when each method returns self, allowing the next method to be called on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n"
